	class Solution {
	public:
	    char findTheDifference(string s, string t) {
	        map<char,int> mp;
	        for( int i=0; i<t.size(); i++ )
	            mp[t[i]]++;
	        for( int i=0; i<s.size(); i++ ){
	            mp[s[i]]--;
	            if( mp[s[i]] == 0 )
	                mp.erase(s[i]);
	        }
	        return mp.begin()->first;
